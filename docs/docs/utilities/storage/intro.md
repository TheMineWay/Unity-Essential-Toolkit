# Introduction

This utility allows you to easily perform I/O operations to different storages like PlayerPrefs easily.

## Features

Why you might want to use this package?

This package uses a standard I/O interface that allows you to use one single API to interact with different storages (official ones provided by the package or customs created by you). Also, it provides storage division by slots so you can create and switch to a different storage slot that is fully independent of the others. This can help build games that allow multiple game save spaces.
